// It's important that this can't be cloned or copied! Unlike MediaTrack and Co. we have a a
// function section_from_unique_id() which doesn't require unsafe code because it passes a
// guaranteed valid `&KbdSectionInfo` to a user-defined closure. The referred object
// (`KbdSectionInfo`) *must not* be copied, otherwise it would be possible to let the
// `KbdSectionInfo` escape the closure - without any unsafe code! Validity could not be guaranteed
// anymore.
//
// So if we just use it as reference, why don't we wrap a *reference* of `raw::KbdSectionInfo` in
// the first place? Then it would be clear that this type is borrow-only! Problem: We actually have
// an unsafe function that returns this type directly (not as a reference). It's marked as unsafe
// because returning it means that Rust loses control and consumers have to make sure themselves
// that the lifetime is long enough. Now, if this wrapper would wrap a reference instead of a raw
// pointer, we wouldn't be able to return a value at all because we can't return a reference created
// in a function. Besides, we wouldn't be able to give that reference a correct lifetime annotation.
