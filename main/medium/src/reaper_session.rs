/// This is the main hub for accessing medium-level API functions.
///
/// In order to use this struct, you first must obtain an instance of it by invoking [`new()`]
/// or [`load()`].
/// This struct itself is limited to REAPER functions for registering/unregistering certain things.
/// You can access all the other functions by calling [`reaper()`].
///
/// Please note that this struct will take care of unregistering everything (also audio hooks)
/// automatically when it gets dropped (good RAII manners).
///
/// # Design
///
/// ## Why is there a separation into `ReaperSession` and `Reaper`?
///
/// Functions for registering/unregistering things have been separated from the rest because they
/// require more than just access to REAPER function pointers. They also need data structures to
/// keep track of the registered things and to offer them a warm and cosy place in memory. As a
/// result, this struct gains special importance, needs to be mutable and can't just be cloned as
/// desired. But there's no reason why this restriction should also apply to all other REAPER
/// functions. After all, being able to clone and pass things around freely can simplify things a
/// lot.
///
/// ### Example
///
/// Here's an example how things can get difficult without the ability to clone: In order to be able
/// to use REAPER functions also from e.g. the audio hook register, we would need to wrap it in an
/// `Arc` (not an `Rc`, because we access it from multiple threads). That's not enough though for
/// most real-world cases. We probably want to register/unregister things (in the main thread) not
/// only in the beginning but also at a later time. That means we need mutable access. So we end up
/// with `Arc<Mutex<ReaperSession>>`. However, why going through all that trouble and put up with
/// possible performance issues if we can avoid it?
